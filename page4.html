                <b>Hardware</b><br>
                -Hardware comprises the physical components that make up a computer system.<br>
                -Components work together to process data and provide outputs (Clements, 2006).<br>
                -Hardware is the machinery of a computer, distinct from software, which consists of the instructions guiding the hardware (Smith, 1989).<br><br>
                <b>Why is it essentel to know about hardware?</b><br>   
                Understanding computer hardware is essential for students, it builds knowledge of computer operation and troubleshooting systems. 
                This allows the students to have practical skills for debugging and selecting hardware. This allows students to appreciate the full 
                scope of computing and makes them more effective in technical roles (Clement, 2006).<br>   
                Clement (2006) also mentions how computer architecture is relevant as it enhances the understanding of computer systems and can
                 improve software performance if it is written with the knowledge of the underlying hardware.

            <b>Computerization and e-Government in Jordan (Nagi & Hamdan, 2009)  </b> <br>
            Through computerization, Jordan successfully entered the information age. Hardware and software play a major role in this development, 
            particularly in the development of its e-government. Hardware forms the foundation of computer systems, allowing components to work together 
            to generate specific outputs. On the other hand, software creates programs that communicate with hardware, producing useful applications for 
            society. For example, Jordan’s e-government enhances public services and strengthens government interactions with citizens, businesses, and 
            industries worldwide, advancing connectivity and efficiency (Al Nagi & Jamdan, 2009).

                <b>The computer becomes a real-time control system (Haigh & Ceruzzi, 2021)</b> <br>
                During the Cold War computers played a vital role, digital computers were reconfigured to respond immediately to world changes such as 
                tracking inbound bombers or controlling the engines of spacecraft. Minuteman intercontinental missiles were guided by miniaturized
                 programmable computers and disk drives. Both Hardware and software were essential in the Cold War, as different technicians and 
                 scientists were able to create technologies that were capable of real-time monitoring to assist in the war. Namely the “SAGE”, 
                 “Whirlwind”, “ENIAC”, “Minuteman Missiles”, and many more (Haigh & Ceruzzi, 2021). These innovations paved the way for the real-time
                  technologies we rely on today, such as air traffic control systems, GPS navigation, and live data processing used in various industries 
                  like telecommunications, finance, and healthcare.

                According to Haigh & Ceruzzi (2021), by the late 1960s, the software industry began to grow, with companies purchasing software 
                products across various sectors. By 1982, the industry generated over $5 billion annually. Initially, companies developed custom 
                software, but SAP (Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung) revolutionized the market by standardizing software solutions. By creating
                 modular software for functions like purchasing, inventory, and accounting, SAP enabled seamless integration across business processes,
                  showcasing how software enhances business efficiency and performance.

                <b>What is a Motherboard? <br></b>
                The motherboard, often regarded as the core of a computer system, is commonly referred to by other names such as the system board or main 
                board. It serves as a central hub, housing essential components that enable the computer to function effectively and efficiently. 
                Additionally, it facilitates connections to all internal components within the cabinet and provides pathways for various peripheral
                 devices, forming an integrated system (James, 2013).

                <b>Introduction<br></b>
                Computers are now a part of our everyday lives, revolutionizing our way of living. Computers are present 
                in many different areas of career, from Medicine, Architecture, Engineering, and many more. Computers have 
                made things easy for us: computing, sharing, and connectivity. But have you ever wondered how computers are 
                present in a lot of different fields? How are computers able to cater to the needs of a specific field of work? 
                Are there specific computers for each kind of field? That is true; there are types of computers with different 
                functions and parts that cater to different kinds of tasks. There are six types of computers: Supercomputers, 
                Mainframe computers, Minicomputers, Servers, Workstations, and Microcomputers. All these computers cater to the 
                specific needs of different users, showcasing the beauty of computers.

                <b>Supercomputer<br></b>
                According to Wang (2020), supercomputers are a powerful computer that can process large amounts of data. 
                It is also the fastest and most expensive type of computer. It is used for complex calculations and engineering 
                problems. With its fast processing speed, Companies can accomplish calculations very quickly, completing tasks 
                that might otherwise require days, weeks, or even months (Chandler, 2023). These computers are often found at places
                 like atomic research centers, spy agencies, scientific institutes, or weather forecasting stations (Chandler, 2023). 
                For example, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, in the USA, this laboratory possesses a supercomputer called 
                “Frontier.” On May 30, 2020, the Frontier was named the fastest supercomputer on the 59th Top500 list; its computing 
                performance is beyond amazing, with a threshold of quintillion calculations per second (Frontier Supercomputer Debuts
                as World’s Fastest, Breaking Exascale Barrier | ORNL, 2022). This type of computer is useful for companies that require 
                intense computational power to analyze datasets and solve problems that demand high-performance computing.

                <b>Mainframe Computers</b>
                Mainframe computers are high-performance computers with large memory and data processors used for large information-processing jobs.
                 These computers are used to perform different kinds of tasks concurrently, from data processing to computing (Wang, 2020). Mainframe
                  computers and supercomputers are quite similar, they both offer fast processing capabilities, the only difference is that mainframe 
                  computers are used for bulk data processing like census, industry, and consumer statistics. Basically, its ultimate goal is data 
                  reliability. A mainframe computer serves as a central data repository that links different workstations in an organization’s data 
                  processing center (Z/OS Basic Skills, n.d.). These computers are crucial for libraries, large businesses, and health care, which 
                  focus on keeping thousands of data safe and secure while performing thousands of tasks simultaneously.

                <b>Minicomputers <br></b>
                According to Wang (2020), minicomputers are a medium-sized computer that falls between a mainframe and a microcomputer in 
                terms of size, processing power, speed, storage capacity, and other capabilities. They offer the same abilities as the mainframe 
                computers but to a limited extent. According to The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica (2009), minicomputers are useful in 
                scientific and engineering computations, business transaction processing, file handling, and database management.

                <b>Server Computer <br></b>
                Server computers are central computers that contain collections of data and programs. Chandler (2023),
                 mentioned how server computers are different from the standard desktop or PC, you don’t sit down at a 
                 server and type. Instead, a server provides computer power through a local area network (LAN). A server 
                 computer offers a wide range of capabilities, such as web hosting, network storage, and application processing.
                  They are essential for businesses and organizations that require large amounts of data for storage and management. 
                  This computer consists of more RAM and reliable power sources, making it more powerful to accommodate to the different 
                  operations (What Is a Computer Server | Lenovo Philippines, 2023).

                According to Chandler (2023), a workstation is just like a desktop computer but has a more powerful processor, 
                additional memory, and high-end graphics adapters, and is more expensive. These computers are meant to be used by 
                one user at a time. High-end workstations possess the processing power to support high-resolution or 3D graphic
                 interfaces, making them suitable for demanding scientific and engineering tasks (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998).

                Microcomputers also known as “Personal Computers (PC)” are devices with a microprocessor as a CPU. 
                These computers are designed for individual use and are typically compact, inexpensive, and versatile. 
                They are mostly used in homes, schools, and workplaces. They cater to various tasks such as word processing, 
                browsing the internet, gaming, and managing data. Examples of microcomputers are: desktops, laptops, smartphones, 
                tablets, calculators, and gaming consoles (The Evolution of Microcomputers: From Past to Present | Lenovo US, 2023).

                <b>Comparison <br></b>
                Minicomputers, microcomputers, workstations, and servers all differ in their level of performance and are used for 
                different purposes. The Honeywell-Bull DPS 6 minicomputer has moderate processing power and up to 8 MB of RAM and is
                 used by large organizations for tasks like data processing, and they consume only 1-2kW of power. On the other hand,
                  microcomputers such as the Asus Zenbook OLED 14 are personal computers/personal laptops. They are used for everyday 
                  tasks such as browsing, media viewing, and simple calculations, with a lower power consumption of 65W and up to 16 GB 
                  of RAM. The HP Z8 G5 workstations, designed for tasks like 3D design and video editing, have plenty of memory of up to 
                  1 TB and a higher processing power, using around 1700W of energy. The Dell PowerEdge R740 servers, which handle tasks 
                  like running websites and managing databases, offer a stronger performance with up to 3 TB of RAM and moderate energy 
                  consumption. In short, server computers offer faster performance and a higher memory capacity than the minicomputer, 
                  microcomputers, and workstations. This is followed by the workstation, which offers a faster processing speed and greater 
                  memory to handle heavy tasks. Then, the minicomputers offer a faster processing speed and greater memory capacity than the
                   microcomputer.
