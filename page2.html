                According to Kuzmiakova (1901), Computer Science is a study that deals with algorithmic processes. Computer science as a discipline is a wide range of
                 concepts, from theoretical studies, computation, and information to practical issues.   Computer Science is one of the fastest-growing career paths we 
                 have today, it is high-paying and is considered as a key part of five related disciplines namely: information technology, Computer Engineering, Computer 
                 Science, Information Technology, Information Systems, and Software Engineering (Peckham et al., 2000).

            <h4>Computer Science</h4>
            In the early 1960s, computer science programs were established at various universities, often 
            emerging from mathematics or engineering departments (Lunt & Ekstrom, 2008). The focus of this
             discipline is on the development of algorithms, theories, concepts, and other foundational topics. 
             According to Mohammed and Wabwoba (2023) a solid grasp of mathematics is essential for most computer 
             science programs.Unlike fields that emphasize application deployment and configuration, computer science
              is primarily concerned with theoretical research and the design of software solutions (Courte & Bishop-Clark, 2009).      
              </p1>

        <p1>
            <h4>Information Systems</h4>
              This program developed alongside the Computer Science discipline, originating within business schools, particularly 
              in accounting programs (Lunt & Ekstrom, 2008). This discipline is heavily business-oriented, it combines the knowledge 
              of business and technology. It enables organizations to efficiently analyze, design, and manage their data (Mohammed & Wabwoba, 2023).
               IS professionals are crucial in businesses as they convert computing-related information into effective business strategies 
               (Galliers & Leidner, 2014) .

        <p1>
            <h4>Computer Engineering</h4>
            In the late 1980s, the Computer Engineering program emerged together with software engineering. This discipline focuses 
            on optimizing computer hardware and certain software systems (Mohammed & Wabwoba, 2023). It plays a crucial role in technological 
            advancement; without Computer Engineering, the technologies we have today wouldn't exist. This discipline is fundamental and irreplaceable, 
            providing the essential foundation for the functioning of other computing fields (Mohammed & Wabwoba, 2023).

            <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
            This discipline focuses on large-scale systems development. According to Courte and Bishop-Clark (2009), “Software engineering is the application 
            of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software.”  It applies engineering principles 
            to software development which is crucial in supporting the software applications that enable various operations in businesses, institutions, and 
            daily life (Mohammed & Wabwoba, 2023).

        <p1>
            <h4>Information Technology</h4>
            This discipline was the last to emerge, it surfaced due to the use of the Internet (Lunt & Ekstrom, 2008). This discipline focuses on what humans need, 
            it troubleshoots and designs practical technical applications and it applies technical knowledge for product support. This discipline prioritizes hands-on
             experience and practical knowledge (Mohammed & Wabwoba, 2023). IT professionals focus on addressing human  concerns related to computing technology. Making 
             it a dynamic field since it involves using areas of computing to tackle problems faced by organizations.

            <b>Data</b> - According to Batini and Scannapieco (2016) , data is anything that has no context that is meaningful, it can be a character ,
             text, word, and number.  <br> <br>
             <b>Information</b>- Information is data when given context, processed, and structured to make it meaningful to humans (Kenett & Redman, 2019) .

            It enables businesses to efficiently evaluate, design, and manage data (Mohammed & Wabwoba, 2023). IS experts are critical 
            in firms because they translate computing-related data into efficient business strategies (Galliers & Leidner, 2014). 
            <h4>Why is it Essential?</h4>
            -According to K. C. Laudon and Laudon (2020), over the past two decades, business has experienced significant changes. <br>
            -There has been a substantial increase in investments in information technology and information systems.<br>
            -Smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and emails have become crucial tools for businesses.<br>
            -Digital advertising has become a key business strategy for many entrepreneurs (K. C. Laudon & Laudon, 2020).<br>
            -Global spending on digital advertising was projected to reach almost $570 billion in 2022 (K. C. Laudon & Laudon, 2020).<br>
            -From 2014 to 2021, digital advertising spending grew by more than 20% annually.<br>
            -These advancements have allowed businesses to reach a broader audience for their products.
